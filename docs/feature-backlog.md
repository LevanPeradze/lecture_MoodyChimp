# Feature & Functionality Backlog

This backlog will grow once you decide on the project idea. For now, it is a placeholder so we can instantly capture ideas when they appear.

## How to use later
- Add each potential feature as a bullet and include a short reason why it matters.
- Group features by release or theme when the list gets longer.
- Reference this file when prioritizing what to build next.

_Waiting for the initial product idea—ready to update as soon as you provide it._
