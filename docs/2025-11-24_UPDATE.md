# 2025-11-24 Update

## What happened
- Initialized separate frontend (React + Vite) and backend (Express) workspaces.
- Installed all required dependencies and added nodemon for easier backend dev.
- Added a starter API endpoint at `/api/status` that returns placeholder data.
- Created the documentation framework: backlog, high-level architecture, and this daily update log.
- Designed the MoodyChimp landing page structure (header, hero, works, about, footer) with the requested brutalist, futuristic-meets-vintage styling cues.
- Iterated on MoodyChimp styling based on feedback: enlarged and re-fonted the hero title, expanded the hero height, rebalanced the palette to warmer yellows + softer blues, and added bolder typography plus blue 3D shadows.
- Follow-up polish: oversized the hero title further, restored vertical stacking for the side keywords, simplified the title shadow to a single blue plane, and trimmed the hero height/padding to keep things readable.
- Full redesign: rebuilt the layout with a calmer, future-vintage aesthetic (new header, hero, works list, about copy) using Nebulica + Space Mono, muted contrasts, and simplified components to keep things beginner-friendly.
- Rolled back to the original requested structure (header, hero with side words, works, about, footer) and tightened colors/spacing so everything is easier to comprehend; added consistent 3D hover effects per section without extra flourishes.

## Next focus
- Capture the actual product idea to start filling the feature backlog.
- Hook the frontend UI to the backend status endpoint once UI scaffolding exists.
- Flesh out the content for "Our Works" cards with real data and plan first interactive feature (e.g., hover reveals, case-study modal).
- Explore next pass of interactions (e.g., hero title animation or works hover states) and start preparing copy/assets for real case studies.
- Evaluate how the simplified layout feels in-browser, then plan future animations or data hookups without adding unnecessary complexity.
- Collect next round of styling feedback once this spec-accurate baseline is approved before layering on new sections.
